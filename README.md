# 1. Context and Existing Research

In recent years, the global coffee industry has witnessed significant development and diversification. The *2023 China Urban Coffee Development Report* shows that Shanghai has 8,530 cafes, ranking first in the world and far ahead of cities such as New York, London, and Tokyo. [Jeffrey Neilson and Ju-Han Zoe Wang (2019)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/sjtg.12279) analyze China and the changing economic geography of coffee value chains, concluding that the changing economic geography of coffee value chains, and their increasing driven-ness by Chinese actors, is starting to reshape the regional coffee industry in profoundly new ways. [Yingchun You1 and Jia Zhang (2022)](https://isprs-archives.copernicus.org/articles/XLVIII-3-W2-2022/79/2022/isprs-archives-XLVIII-3-W2-2022-79-2022.pdf), taking Starbucks and Luckin as an example, explore the new retail location based on GIS spatial analysis. This topic aims to discover the similarities and differences between international chain coffee shops and local chain coffee shops in terms of store locations.

# 2. Research Question

How do international chain coffee shops differ from local chain coffee shops in terms of spatial distribution across various districts in Shanghai?

# 3. Hypothesis

International chain coffee shops are more likely to concentrate in central business districts (CBDs), while local chain coffee stores may demonstrate a more dispersed pattern across CBDs and residential areas.

# 4. Exploration and Addressing the RQ

To explore this topic, a comprehensive approach can be employed. Geographic Information System (GIS) maps can be used for spatial analysis to visually show the distribution patterns of international and local coffee shops in various districts of Shanghai. This gives a comprehensive picture of geographical concentration. The spatial distribution patterns between international and local chain coffee shops can be compared to discover the similarities and differences to assess whether these align with theoretical expectations or contradict existing literature.

# 5. Data Needed

- Spatial Data: GIS data indicating the locations of international and local chain coffee shops in Shanghai.
- Demographic Data: Population density, income levels, and other demographic information for each district.
- Market Share and Financial Data: Information on market share and financial performance of the coffee shops.

# 6. Tools and Methods

- GIS Mapping: Use Geographic Information System tools for spatial analysis.
- Statistical Analysis: Employing statistical methods to analyze demographic and financial data with the software Python.
- Social Media Comments Analysis: Analyze user comments and feedback on social media about these coffee stores using text mining and sentiment analysis methods to understand consumer perceptions of different brands in different regions.
